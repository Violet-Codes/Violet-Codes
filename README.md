### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a self taught developer with an affinity for mathematics and its applications in development.
I programme mainly in Haskell, Rust, and Python.
I excell in functional programming and am familiar with composition, dependency injection, and the Monad and Monad transformer patterns.
