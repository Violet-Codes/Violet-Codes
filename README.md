### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer with an affinity for mathematics and its applications in development.
I program mainly in Haskell, Rust, and TypeScript.
I excel at learning and applying design patterns such as Composition, Dependency Injection and Mutability Safety.

I work best with languages with monad `do` block support, and in code bases where behaviour is defined almost entirely by composition, for more info on monads as a pattern see my blog: [Monads for the layman](https://violet-codes.github.io/#/blogs/blog/Monads-for-the-layman/).
