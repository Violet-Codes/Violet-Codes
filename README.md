### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught developer with an affinity for mathematics and its applications in development.
I program mainly in Haskell, Rust, and Python.
I excel in functional programming and am familiar with composition, dependency injection, and the Monad and Monad transformer patterns.
